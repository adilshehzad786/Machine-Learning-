# Machine-Learning-
<strong> You need an Extracting Third Party Software Because Machine Learning Files not Supported on github<strong> 
  
This repository contains implementations of basic machine learning algorithms in plain Python (Python Version 3.6+). All algorithms are implemented from scratch without using additional machine learning libraries. The intention of these notebooks is to provide a basic understanding of the algorithms and their underlying structure, not to provide the most efficient implementations

<strong> Simple Steps for Machine Learning<strong>
  
  1) Import the data
  2) Clean the data (Duplicate Files)
  3) Splite the data into Training/Test Sets
  4) Create a Model
  5) Make a Predictions
  6) Evaluate and Improve
  
  <strong> Libraries and tool for Machine Learning <strong>
  
   1)Numpy
   2)Pandas
   3)Matplotlib
   4)Scikit-learn
   
  Environment : <strong> Jupyter  & Anaconda <strong>
  <strong>Type Jupyter Notebook in Anaconda CMD <strong>
